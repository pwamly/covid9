service to consume covid9 service

# How to run the service ?

[1] This service has writen in javascript/nodejs so in order
to run it you have to have nodejs installed in your device.

[2] After clone the service from github make sure you install
all the dependencies by << npm install >>.

[3] I have adde the postaman collection jsaon file at the root folder
covid9.postman_collection.json, to help guide you on how to interact
with the service.

[4] Thanks and stay safe.
